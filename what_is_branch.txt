Explain what a branch is, in your own words:

This is a list of changes that enables you to create a parallel universe for your code. This is useful for experiments. You can merge your branch into the master if you are happy with your new universe or kill it if the experiment fails.

You create a branch by typing:

git checkout -b 'branch name'
